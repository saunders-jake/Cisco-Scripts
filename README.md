# Cisco-Scripts

##### This is a collection of various scripts I created in my CCNA Route/Switch and CCNA Security courses in high school.

## harden.cisco-asa
This file contains commands from the CIS benchmark for Cisco ASA firewalls. It also includes comments to describe what each command is doing.

## commandsOnly.cisco-asa
This file is the same as harde.cisco-asa, but it doesn't have comments. It could be edited into a script to harden an ASA.

## CCNASecurityCommands.cisco-ios
This file contains commands from the CCNA Security Netacad cirriculum. I was curating it while studying for the certification test, but never ended up taking the exam, so I beleive it is incomplete.

## CCNASecurityFinal.md
My CCNA Security instructor allowed us to create scripts for our Packet Tracer final exam. This is the result.
